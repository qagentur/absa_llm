These guidelines detail Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Annotation for restaurant and laptop customer reviews. The aim is to determine aspect terms and their sentiment polarities within sentences. Aspect terms are words or phrases describing the specific attributes of the target entity. Sentiment polarity can be positive, negative, or neutral. For aspect terms, annotators should mark nominal phrases explicitly mentioning aspects and verbs or verbal names of aspects. Subjectivity indicators, references to the target entity as a whole, and the name, type, or model of the laptop or restaurant should not be considered as aspect terms. Also, pronouns and implicit aspect terms should not be annotated. For sentiment polarity, an aspect term should be classified as positive or negative if the sentence expresses a positive or negative opinion. Neutral polarity should be assigned when a neutral sentiment or factual information is given about an aspect, or when the sentiment is inferred but not explicit.
